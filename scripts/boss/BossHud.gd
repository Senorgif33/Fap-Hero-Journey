## The encounter's own chrome: the boss's name, a health bar that DRAINS as the round runs, split into
## one stage per authored phase, and the phase banner beneath.
##
## Shared by the round and the encounter editor's preview stage, deliberately. It is the chrome an
## author's cues have to live around — a subtitle placed at the top has to clear this, and the top
## clearance in BossCueLayer is sized against it — so previewing a hand-drawn mock of roughly the right
## shape would defeat the point. One implementation means the thing being cleared in the preview is the
## same thing that will be there in the round.
##
## Presentation only: it is told the round's progress and which phase started, and knows nothing about
## the timeline, the scheduler or the device.

# Where the block sits down the screen by default, as a fraction: just clear of the top edge. It does
# not replace the bottom progress bar, because the encounter's own name and phase line need room to read
# and the bottom of the screen is where dialogue lives — but an author whose cast art wants that corner
# can move the whole block, so this is only where it STARTS.

# It began as a rate-limited chase and showed nothing at all. Damage does not arrive in chunks: score
# accrues per keyframe pair as the script advances (§13.7), so the bar drains as a smooth trickle and a

# proportional to the CURRENT drain rate — thin while she is guarding, twice as wide through an opening
