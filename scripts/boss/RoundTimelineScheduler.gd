class_name RoundTimelineScheduler
extends RefCounted
## Decides WHAT should happen on a boss timeline at a given video position — and nothing else. It
## starts no overrides, pushes no effects and draws nothing: `tick()` returns a plain decision record
## and the GameLoop applies it. That split is the whole point: the timing rules (crossings, windows,
## seeks, loop replays, phases) are the fiddly part, and keeping them free of engine calls means they
## are unit-tested headlessly instead of debugged in a live boss round.
##
## Two kinds of event, two rules — and which one an event is depends on its TRACK, not on whether it
## happens to have a duration:
##   • ONE-SHOT — fires once, on a forward crossing of its time. A fired-set keeps it from re-firing
##     while the round plays on. Attacks and audio cues are always one-shots: their duration describes
##     how long the MEDIA runs (and which slice of it plays), not a window to be held open. An attack
##     whose length made it "windowed" would never fire at all.
##   • WINDOWED — active exactly while `at <= pos < at + duration`, RECONCILED every tick rather than
##     toggled by events. Reconciliation is idempotent, which is what makes pause, seek and replay fall
##     out for free instead of each needing their own special case. Effects are always windows; a cast
##     cue is one only when given a duration, otherwise it is a flash.
##
## Positions come from the round's video, so PAUSE needs no handling at all: the position stops moving
## and every rule above is a no-op. Seeks and loop replays do need handling — see seek() and reset().
##
## Typical driving (GameLoop side):
##     var d := scheduler.tick(video_pos_ms)
##     apply d["stop"], then d["start"], then d["fire"]   # tear down before building up
##     if d["phase_changed"]: update the phase banner / tint

# A forward jump larger than this is treated as a SEEK, not as playback catching up. Without it, one
# stalled frame (a slow video load, a device re-anchor the caller forgot to announce) would dump every
# one-shot it flew past into a single tick — a burst of attacks and cues firing at once. Skipping a cue
# is the far better failure of the two. Generous enough that ordinary hitching never trips it.
