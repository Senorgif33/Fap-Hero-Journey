class_name BossTimelineEditor
extends Node
## The boss-encounter editor: a near-fullscreen modal pairing a live PREVIEW STAGE (the round's video
## with cast cues, subtitles and animations drawn over it) with the BossTimeline lanes, a Boss Kit to
## add events from, an inspector for the selected one, and live validation (BOSS_ROUND_DESIGN §6).
##
## The preview is driven by the REAL RoundTimelineScheduler — the same object the GameLoop ticks — so
## what an author sees is the runtime's own decisions rather than a second implementation that could
## drift from it. Playing seeks the video and ticks the scheduler; scrubbing seeks it, which reconciles
## windows and re-arms one-shots exactly as a device re-anchor would mid-round.
##
## The device is deliberately NOT driven while previewing: scrubbing back and forth would jerk it
## repeatedly. Attacks are felt through the explicit ▶ TEST ON DEVICE on a selected attack instead.
##
## A Node (not a RefCounted) because playback needs a per-frame tick, and because being in the tree
## means the modal it owns is freed with it — the caller does not have to keep it alive.
##
## The timeline it edits is always kept in RoundTimeline's canonical shape: every mutation runs back
## through normalize(), so the editor cannot invent a shape the runtime would not accept, and the
## validation shown here is literally the validation the presave gate will run.

## The author pressed SAVE. Carries the edited timeline, already normalized.
