class_name OverrideTestPlayer
extends Node

# Plays an override bundle on the connected device straight from the builder, so an author can FEEL a slice
# while trimming it — no round required. It drives the two device paths the same way a round does, but on
# its own elapsed clock:
#   • Serial / Buttplug / restim (C# FunscriptPlayer): BeginOverride free-runs on its own clock even with no
#     round loaded; Stop() ends it.
#   • Handy WiFi (HSP): the normal load_actions → start(clock) → feed(clock) → stop() path, gated on a live
#     connection (the round-scoped start_override path needs a playing round, which the builder hasn't got).
# Effects are already baked into the bundle by the editor, so both paths play it raw. Added as a child of the
# timeline; freeing it (editor rebuild / modal close) auto-stops via _exit_tree so the device is never left
# running.

signal state_changed(playing: bool)  # true on start, false on stop/finish — drives the button label
