extends Control
## The encounter editor's picture: the round's video with the round's OWN cue layer, audio, sensory
## engine, health bar and scheduler running over it.
##
## Extracted from BossTimelineEditor because "the preview matches the round" is a contract, not a
## coincidence, and it kept quietly breaking while the wiring for it was scattered through a 2200-line
## modal. Every part here is the same class the GameLoop drives — BossCueLayer, BossAudioCues,
## SensoryFX, EffectWindowFades, BossHud, RoundTimelineScheduler — so an author tuning a fade, a
## placement or a line's position is tuning the thing that will actually play. Anything that has to be
## reimplemented here rather than reused is a bug waiting to happen; there is deliberately none of it.
##
## Attacks are the one exception and are skipped on purpose: the device is driven solely by
## ▶ TEST ON DEVICE, so scrubbing the timeline can never jerk it.
##
## Knows nothing about the timeline document, selection, undo or the inspector. It is handed a timeline
## to rebuild against, told to seek, and reports where the playhead reached.

## The author clicked the picture, which is how they get back to the encounter's own settings.
