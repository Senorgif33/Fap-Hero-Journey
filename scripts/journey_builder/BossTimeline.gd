class_name BossTimeline
extends Control
## The boss encounter's authoring surface: the round's clock drawn as LANES of event blocks — attacks,
## effects, cast cues and audio (BOSS_ROUND_DESIGN §6). Phases are NOT here: they begin at a health
## point rather than a time, so they live with the health bar's other settings. Blocks are
## dragged to move, their right edge dragged to resize, and clicked to select; CTRL+wheel zooms around
## the cursor and middle-drag pans, exactly like the override editor's timeline.
##
## Purely a view/input widget, like OverrideTimeline: it owns no journey data and writes nothing back.
## Edits leave as signals and the editor decides what they mean, which is what keeps undo, validation
## and persistence in one place instead of smeared through the drawing code.
##
## Positions are milliseconds on the round's clock. END-anchored events are resolved for display
## through RoundTimeline.resolve_at_ms, so an event authored as "10 s before the end" sits where it will
## actually play; dragging one reports a new offset measured from whichever end it is anchored to.
##
## (The ms↔x mapping, zoom and pan mirror OverrideTimeline's. They are deliberately re-stated rather
## than shared: that widget is shipped and verified, and hoisting a base class out from under it is a
## refactor worth doing on its own, not in the middle of building this.)

##
## Its own signal rather than a move plus a resize, because for a media block the two are one gesture
## with one meaning: cut this much off the FRONT of the source. Reported as a move would have slid the
## block later and then cut its tail, which is the opposite of what the drag looks like.
