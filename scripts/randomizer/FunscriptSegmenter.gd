class_name FunscriptSegmenter
extends RefCounted
## Cuts a funscript's action list into BEATS — the smallest self-contained units a
## randomizer round can be built from. Pure and disk-free like FunscriptIntensity,
## whose average_speed()/bucket() produce every number reported here; the project
## deliberately has only one rating scale.
##
## The structure comes from the script itself, not from the video: scripters stop
## at scene changes and mark passages by changing tempo. Three passes exploit that —
## pauses, then tempo changes inside anything still too long, then a cleanup that
## folds fragments into the neighbour they resemble and drops what is too short or
## too lifeless to be worth playing.
##
## Every boundary lands on a real action timestamp. A round that starts mid-stroke
## is worthless, so this rule has no exception — not even for the even division that
## breaks up a metronome.
##
## Output per beat: {in_ms, out_ms, speed, intensity, action_count}, sorted by in_ms.
## out_ms is INCLUSIVE and no action belongs to two beats, so consecutive beats
## satisfy out_ms < next.in_ms. Beats do NOT tile the video: pauses and discarded
## dead passages stay as holes between them, which is why any length arithmetic
## downstream must use the beat span and never the video duration.

# The "activity" a beat is scored on. STROKE = travel speed (a stroke script's position moving);
# LEVEL = time-weighted average level (a vibration script's buzz). Every pass — pauses, tempo/level
# changes, dead-drop, intensity bucket — is identical; only the metric _Prep accumulates differs,
# so a vibration track is cut and rated by the same code, its steady-buzz sections reading as active
# rather than "dead" the way travel speed would score them.

# A gap longer than this is a hard boundary. Shorter ones are part of the rhythm.

## Read-only, flattened view of the normalized action list, built once per segment()
## call. It exists purely for speed: the passes below ask the same two questions over
## and over — "how fast is this index range?" and "what is the tempo score at this
## action?" — and answering them by slicing the action array was quadratic on scripts
## that keep changing tempo without ever pausing (the tempo pass rescans its whole
## block on every recursion level, and every candidate paid for two Array.slice()
## allocations plus two summation loops).
##
## The dictionaries are gone; what survives is what the passes read.

# Step 2 — recursively splits a block that is still longer than max_ms at its
# sharpest tempo change: the action where the average speed of the window before it
# differs most from the window after it. Both halves must stay usable, so a change
# too close to an edge is not a candidate. Each split moves at least one action to
# either side, which is what terminates the recursion.
#
# The naive form scored every candidate from scratch on every recursion level, which
# is quadratic when the sharpest change sits near a block start (the big remainder is
# rescanned in full, over and over). Two observations make the rescan cheap without
# changing which action wins:
#
#  1. A candidate's score depends ONLY on its two windows — never on the block — as
#     long as neither window is clamped by a block edge. Those scores are therefore
#     the same on every recursion level and are precomputed once, in prep.delta.
#  2. Clamping happens exactly to the candidates within win_ms of an edge, and "within
#     win_ms of an edge" is monotone in at[m]. So the clamped candidates form a prefix
#     and a suffix of the candidate range; only those are rescored here, and they are
#     rescored with the identical expression, so an over-wide zone would still give
#     the identical number.
#
# The three sub-scans below therefore visit the same candidates, in the same ascending
# order, with the same values as the single loop they replace — and keep the same
# `strictly greater` comparison, so a tie still keeps the earliest action.
