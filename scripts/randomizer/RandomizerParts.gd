class_name RandomizerParts
extends RefCounted
## Expansion layer between the randomizer library and RandomizerGenerator: turns a
## video entry's funscript BEATS (FunscriptSegmenter output, persisted in the
## registry's `parts` field) into round-sized PARTS, each emitted as a pseudo-entry
## in the existing entry format. The generator therefore only ever sees "more
## clips" and stays untouched — that is the whole point of this file, and the
## reason the tiling below must be gapless and overlap-free: a generator that had
## to reject overlapping candidates would have to be rewritten.
##
## Pure and seeded, like RandomizerGenerator: the only entropy is the caller's rng
## (same seed → same cuts → reproducible run), and the only I/O is the stat-level
## read inside JourneyData.media_fingerprint, which is unavoidable because the
## generator needs the pooled rels already present on the entry. No file-existence
## gating, no writes — so this is fully testable headless.
##
## Emits pseudo-entries of the shape the generator + RandomizerLibrary consume:
##   { id, name, video_src, funscript_src, axis_src, vib_src, needs_transcode,
##     video_rel, funscript_rel, axis_rel, vib_rel, boss_image_rel,
##     action_count, length_ms, duration_ms, tags, weight, intensity, last_used,
##     added_at, segments:[{in_ms,out_ms}], source_id, part_index, part_count }
## Whole-clip entries pass through as the very same objects, without `segments`.
