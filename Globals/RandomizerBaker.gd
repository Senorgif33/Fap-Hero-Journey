extends Node
## Finishes baking the run that is CURRENTLY being played. The visible Play path only
## prepares the parts of the first two rounds, so the session starts after a minute
## instead of after ten; everything behind those rounds is encoded here, in play order,
## while the user is already playing, and hardlinked into the run folder the moment it
## is done. The arithmetic works out because the encode runs several times faster than
## the playback: the baker gains ground during the session instead of losing it.
##
## The GameLoop asks exactly one question — round_state(index) — before it enters a
## round. Without an active run the answer is always READY, so normal journeys and keep
## runs behave bit-identically and the GameLoop needs no case distinction by run type.
##
## An autoload and not an object on the screen, because the screen does not survive the
## Play: Transition.change_scene destroys RandomizerScreen and every coroutine hanging
## off it dies with it. Autoloads survive scene changes — MediaPoolService's encode
## loops await on get_tree().create_timer() and are the working proof.
##
## The service never touches the EncodeGate itself. It hands BACKGROUND priority to
## prepare_entry_media, and MediaPoolService does the queueing and the preemption.
## See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-progressive-baking-contract.md §1.
