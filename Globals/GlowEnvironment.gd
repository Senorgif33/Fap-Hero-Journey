# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GlowEnvironment  –  app-wide neon bloom
#
# Autoloaded so the whole app shares one glow post-process: the bright palette
# (PURPLE_BRIGHT #b21eff / MAGENTA #e000e0, both near the top of the 0–1 range)
# blooms into a real neon glow instead of the flat 2px borders + fake shadow we
# use elsewhere. One WorldEnvironment under the root viewport covers every scene.
#
# Requires a RenderingDevice backend (Forward+ / Mobile). The project renders
# with d3d12 (Forward+), so glow is available. 2D glow reads the framebuffer and
# blooms any pixel brighter than GLOW_THRESHOLD, which is why the threshold sits
# just under the neon colors. Background mode MUST be Canvas for 2D glow.
#
# Tuning lives in the consts below.
#   • Too strong / washing out bright VIDEO during a round? Lower GLOW_INTENSITY,
#     raise GLOW_THRESHOLD, or call `GlowEnvironment.set_enabled(false)` while a
#     video plays (and true again on the menus).
#   • Want a punchier sign-on-black look? Switch the blend mode to ADDITIVE.
