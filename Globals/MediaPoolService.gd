## Graph-agnostic media operations shared by the journey builder's save pipeline
## and the randomizer library. Resolves the ffmpeg / ffprobe binaries, probes a
## source video (codec / pixel format / duration), decides whether a source needs
## re-encoding for the runtime decoder (EIRTeam.FFmpeg decodes H.264 only), and
## runs the actual transcode.
##
## Pure I/O + process control: it owns no journey / graph / UI state. Progress and
## cancellation are injected as Callables, so any caller wires its own modal — the

#
# Animated WebP is deliberately NOT supported: ffmpeg can *encode* it (libwebp_anim) but has never
# implemented *decoding* it — its only webp decoder is still-image, and that is not a build flag.
# Decoding it would mean bundling libwebp's anim_dump or hand-parsing the ANIM/ANMF container.

# not "does this move".
