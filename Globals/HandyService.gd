#
# Direct WiFi support for The Handy via the official API **v3 / HSP** (Handy
# Streaming Protocol) — no Intiface required.
#
# Unlike the old v2 HSSP "upload the whole script to a public URL and play it",
# HSP STREAMS the script into a small rolling on-device buffer, ≤100 points per
# add. We are the producer: convert the round's funscript to points, feed them
# a few seconds ahead of the video clock, and top the buffer up as the device
# consumes it. `pause_on_starving` means a late refill just pauses the device
# instead of drifting. Native pause/resume/stop; drift handled by re-`play`
# on seek. No third-party file hosting — points transit Handy's relay per batch.
#
# CONSEQUENCES (disclosed in Options):
#   • Motion commands route through Handy's cloud (needs internet). No script
#     FILE is uploaded/hosted anymore — a softer story than v2.
#   • Stroke-modifying items / curses / boss modifiers DO reach the device: we
#     feed the TRANSFORMED script (set_effects bakes them in; a mid-round change
#     flush-refeeds via seek, landing a fraction of a second later).
#   • Stroke RANGE does apply — mapped to the device slider stroke zone.
#
# AUTH (v3, two credentials): the app's registered APPLICATION ID goes in
# X-Api-Key (verified: the ID authenticates device calls directly; the separate
# "application key" only mints bearer tokens via /auth/token/issue, which we
# don't use). Plus the user's CONNECTION key in X-Connection-Key. Both headers
# on every device call. Set the ID via [handy] app_id or DEFAULT_APP_ID.
